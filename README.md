# Instant Messenger
## Description
This is an instant messenger implemented with the Python *socket* module.
## Instructions
1. Download server.py and client.py
2. Open the root directory in two terminals
3. Run command `python3 server.py` in the first terminal
4. Run command `python3 client.py` in the second terminal
